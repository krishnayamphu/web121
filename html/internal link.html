    <h2 id="computer">Computer</h2>
    <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
        (computation)
        automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.
        These
        programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer
        that
        includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full
        operation.
        This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer
        network or
        computer cluster.</p>
    <p>
        A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose
        devices like
        microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and
        computer-aided
        design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.
        Computers power
        the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.</p>

        Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have
        aided people
        in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were
        built to
        automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did
        specialized
        analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed
        during
        World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET
        (MOS
        transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor
        and the
        microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing
        dramatically
        ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the
        Digital
        Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.</p>

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with
        fingers.
        The earliest counting device was most likely a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the
        Fertile
        Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, likely livestock or
        grains,
        sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[a][4] The use of counting rods is one example.


        The Chinese suanpan (算盘). The number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408.
        The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in
        Babylonia as
        early as 2400 BCE. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval
        European
        counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to
        certain rules,
        as an aid to calculating sums of money.[5]</p>

    <p>The first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power. The 50 lb (23 kg) IBM 5100 was an early example.
        Later
        portables such as the Osborne 1 and Compaq Portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in.
        The
        first laptops, such as the Grid Compass, removed this requirement by incorporating batteries – and with the
        continued
        miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in
        popularity
        in the 2000s.[104] The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular
        mobile
        phones by the early 2000s.

        These smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and recently became the dominant computing
        device on
        the market.[105] These are powered by System on a Chip (SoCs), which are complete computers on a microchip the
        size of a
        coin.[103]</p>
